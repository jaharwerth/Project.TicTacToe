I need to creat a Tic Tac Toe board that does the following:
    1✔) type in usernames for Player 1 and Player 2 
    2✔) click the board to either put an "x" or an "o"
        a✔. "x" is Player 1
        b✔. "o" is Player 2
        c✔. you shouldn't be able to click an already filled space
    3✔) with every click, determine whether it was a winning move
        a✔. check for three in a row:
            -✔ column
            -✔ row
            -✔ diagonal x2
    4) if there is a winner, say "Congratulations!"
    5) if every space is filled but no one wins, say "Draw"
    6) create a restart button that clears the game and starts over
        a. clears the board
        b. clears the usernames
