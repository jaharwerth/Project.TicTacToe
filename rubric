As users playing a two player game we want to:
    enter our names and have them displayed
    have our order chosen for us by the game
    take turns placing our marks in empty spaces
    not be able to place our marks in an occupied space
    be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
    start the game over without having to reset the browser

    see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
    have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space
